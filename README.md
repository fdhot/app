This project leverages fuzzy logic distillation to construct thought hypergraphs, enabling precise analysis of citation networks and relevance assessment of academic articles. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with causal inference, it enhances the interpretability and ranking of scholarly content.

### How to Use This Table

1. **Fuzzy Logic in Distillation**  
   Each row maps a specific **FMOps** aspect to a **fuzzy logic** technique, illustrating how **partial truths** and **uncertainty** can be integrated into model distillation processes.

2. **Hypergraph-of-Thoughts**  
   By representing concepts and relationships as **hyperedges**, you can capture complex interdependencies in the reasoning pipeline. Fuzzy memberships (e.g., partial activation or uncertain connections) enrich these hypergraphs with *gradual* rather than *binary* logic.

3. **Implement & Refine**  
   Pick relevant rows (e.g., #10 for “Adaptive Inference” or #20 for “Domain Shift Monitoring”) to design or refine a pipeline that effectively manages **uncertainty**. Over time, your hypergraph can evolve, shedding light on how the model processes ambiguous or incomplete information.
